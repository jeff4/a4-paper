Seymour and I discuss Microsoft's continuing transition out of the PC era, open-source LLMs exemplified by Llama-2, and general discussion of business use cases, adoption, and Elad Gil's piece on [Early Days of AI and the AI Hype Cycle](https://blog.eladgil.com/p/early-days-of-ai).

Link to [episode page](https://www.stepfunction.org/episode-14-end-of-microsoft-pc-beginning-of-microsoft-cp-co-pilot-era) and it's available on all major podcast platforms, including Apple, Google/YouTube, Spotify, Amazon, etc. As usual, just search for 'stepfunction' with no spaces in your favorite podcast player.
