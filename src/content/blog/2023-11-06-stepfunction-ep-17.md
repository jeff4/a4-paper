We discuss the connection between sci-fi, movies, and 'real-world AI' through the 2013 movie [Her](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_(film)).

Link to [episode page](https://www.stepfunction.org/episode-17-ten-years-from-her-2013-to-humane) and it's available on all major podcast platforms, including Apple, Google/YouTube, Spotify, Amazon, etc. As usual, just search for 'stepfunction' with no spaces in your favorite podcast player.
