  New Stepfunction episode exploring image generation as opposed to the usual text generation from LLMs.

New podcast episode exploring image generation including DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion. Seymour and I consider the history of photography, earlier precedents in mechanical and digital reproduction, Napster, etc.

Link to [episode page](https://www.stepfunction.org/episode-4-typeface-and-cezannes-card-players) and it's available on all major podcast platforms, including Apple, Google/YouTube, Spotify, Amazon, etc. As usual, just search for 'stepfunction' with no spaces in your favorite podcast player.
