  First experiments with vim motions in the browser
---

I've started playing around with vim motions in the browser, esp. for macOS. First step has been installing the [vimari](https://televator.net/vimari/) Safari extension. I'll also try the [vimb](https://fanglingsu.github.io/vimb/). Both of the above use [WebKit 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit#WebKit2).

I'll also check the Chrome extension [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io) on Chrome and Firefox. And probably install [Qutebrowser](https://www.qutebrowser.org) to see how I like it. I found the list of *Similar Projects* on the Qutebrowser site to be very helpful.

These explorations were encouraged by this [vim broswer blog post from 2017](https://blog.al4.co.nz/2017/10/vimperator-vimium-and-the-switch-to-qutebrowser/) and more recently by ['A mouseless tale: trying for a keyboard-driven desktop'](https://lwn.net/Articles/1005332/) with related [HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42884099).
