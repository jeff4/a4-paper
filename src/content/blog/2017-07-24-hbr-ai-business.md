Nice [Harvard Business Review article on AI and business](https://hbr.org/cover-story/2017/07/the-business-of-artificial-intelligence) by [Erik Brynjolfsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Brynjolfsson) and [Andrew McAfee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McAfee), professors at MIT and  co-authors of [The Second Machine Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Second_Machine_Age).

Good overview for a general audience.
