  The valley is abuzz discussing an AI strategy memo that is purported to have leaked from Google.
---

A lot of buzz about an [apparently leaked strategy memo](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither) from within Google about how they "have no moate and neither does OpenAI". Larger conversation about AI supply chains, and analogies of gen AI to the rise of the PC and and Linux in early eras of computer history.

Link to [episode page](https://www.stepfunction.org/episode-12-leaked-google-strategy-memo-open-source-ai-value-chains) and it's available on all major podcast platforms, including Apple, Google/YouTube, Spotify, Amazon, etc. As usual, just search for 'stepfunction' with no spaces in your favorite podcast player.
