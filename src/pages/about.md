### Tech Stack

I built this site using [AstroJS](https://astro.build) and the [AstroPaper blog theme](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) created by [Sat Naing](https://github.com/satnaing). AstroPaper mostly uses vanilla JavaScript with a tiny amount of ReactJS for interactivity. Type-safety by [Typescript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript) and styling by [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com). Site is served by [Netlify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netlify). 

#### Some AstroPaper Features

- Fully responsive and accessible
- SEO-friendly
- Light & dark modes
- Fuzzy search
- Draft posts
- Pagination
