### Tech Stack

I built this site by forking the [AstroPaper blog theme](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) created by [Sat Naing](https://github.com/satnaing). 

AstroPaper is built on [AstroJS](https://astro.build), vanilla JavaScript, and a tiny amount of [ReactJS](https://react.dev) for interactivity. Sat used [Typescript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for type safety and styling, respectively. Site is served by [Netlify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netlify).

#### Some AstroPaper Features

- Fully responsive and accessible
- SEO-friendly
- Light & dark modes
- Fuzzy search
- Draft posts
- Pagination
