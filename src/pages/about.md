<h4 class="text-2xl tracking-wider sm:text-3xl">About Me
</h4>

I love to learn and teach. Some recent obsessions: traditional and simplified Mandarin characters, obscure Unix programs from the 70's/80's, HBO's *Succession*, and finding ways to <a href="https://www.stepfunction.org">make AI approachable</a> to new students.

During the last 10 years, I've taught myself vector calculus, linear algebra, [organic chemistry](https://www.instagram.com/dailymolecule), and post-1789 revolutionary history. I have traditional degrees from Harvard and MIT; but lifelong learning has been more fun! ðŸ¤“ 

Professionally, I've worked in Silicon Valley for 20+ years at Microsoft, Amazon, Box, and several startups.

## Tech Stack

I built this site by forking the [AstroPaper blog theme](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) created by [Sat Naing](https://github.com/satnaing). 

AstroPaper is made with [AstroJS](https://astro.build), vanilla JavaScript, and a tiny amount of [ReactJS](https://react.dev) for interactivity. Sat used [Typescript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for type safety and styling, respectively. Site is served by [Netlify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netlify).

### Cool AstroPaper Features

- Fully responsive and accessible
- Light & dark modes
- Fuzzy search
- Simple, stylish design
- Loads and runs fast because AstroJS primarily ships HTML+CSS with virtually no client-side Javascript
